<p id="p01">[#p01] This is a paragraph with no embedded hyphenation hints and no hyphen-related CSS applied.  Corporate gibberish follows.  Think visionary.

Our feature set is unparalleled in the industry, but our reality-based systems and simple use is usually considered a remarkable achievement. The power to brand robustly leads to the aptitude to embrace seamlessly. What do we streamline? Anything and everything, regardless of reconditeness!</p>
